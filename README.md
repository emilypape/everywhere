## Description

Book it Belle is a GraphQL project that had most of the main functionality already established, however, we switched conventional API routing with GraphQL routing.

As soon as you open the page you will be prompted to enter a search term. Upon entering a search tearm it will return a series of books related to that term

![results page](assets/images/results-page.png)

At this point you can sign up or login if so desired, at which point you will be able to add any of the books to a saved book list that will keep your favorite books at arms reach for reference.

From your saved books list when you have read or purchased the book you can then proceed to delete them as desired. All of this functionality provided solely by GraphQL and Apollo server APIs.
